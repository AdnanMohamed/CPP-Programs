
Understand the problem you are trying to solve before attempting to solve it.

write the algorithm(solving steps) before writing the code.

Use the debugger.

If you faced a hard problem and you couldn't solve it from the first attempt,
take some rest and come to it later.

If you wanted to know were is the bug in your program,
try explaining the program line by line to someone or to yourself.
