Knowlegde is what gives me hope to live another day. Knowledge is what makes me
enthusiastic, eager, and powerful. I am in love with knowledge and I hope this 
love never ends. My dream is to keep learning till I die. I don't see that there
is any reason to stop learning. In fact, I don't see any reason to live without learning.
